# Qubit Simulator

Qubit Simulator is a simple and lightweight library that provides a quantum simulator for simulating qubits and quantum gates. It supports basic quantum operations and gates such as Hadamard, $\frac{\pi}{8}$, Controlled-Not, and generic unitary transformations.

## Installation

Install Qubit Simulator via pip:

```bash
pip install qubit-simulator
```

## Usage

### Initializing the Simulator

Create a simulator with a specified number of qubits:

```python
from qubit_simulator import QubitSimulator

simulator = QubitSimulator(3)
```

### Applying Gates

Apply various quantum gates to the qubits:

```python
simulator.h(0)      # Hadamard gate
simulator.t(1)      # Ï€/8 gate
simulator.cx(0, 2)  # Controlled-Not gate
```

### Custom Gates

Define and apply custom gates using angles:

```python
import numpy as np

theta, phi, lambda_ = np.pi/4, np.pi/3, np.pi/2
simulator.u(1, theta, phi, lambda_)  # Generic gate
```

### Measurements

Measure the state of the qubits:

```python
results = simulator.run(shots=100)
```

> {'010': 24, '101': 28, '111': 25, '000': 23}

### Circuit Representation

Get a string representation of the circuit:

```python
print(simulator)
```

```plaintext
-----------------
| H |   | C |   |
|   | T |   | U |
|   |   | X |   |
-----------------
```

## Testing

Tests are included in the package to verify its functionality:

```shell
python3 -m pytest tests/
```
